# Weather Data Pipeline Documentation

## Project Overview
This project was designed to automate the retrieval, storage, and management of weather data from the WeatherStack API. The objective was to establish a structured pipeline that periodically collects weather data, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and ensures its availability for further analysis or integration with other applications.

## Implementation Process

### 1. Fetching Weather Data
**Objective:**
- To obtain real-time weather data from a reliable source and extract meaningful insights.

**Approach:**
- Utilized the `requests` library to send GET requests to the WeatherStack API.
- Implemented robust error handling to manage potential request failures.
- Parsed the JSON response to extract key weather parameters, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and weather descriptions.

### 2. Database Design & Setup
**Objective:**
- To structure and store the collected weather data for efficient retrieval and historical analysis.

**Approach:**
- Designed a PostgreSQL database named `Weather_App`.
- Created a `weather` table with well-defined fields, including city, temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and timestamps.
- Ensured data integrity by assigning appropriate data types and constraints.

### 3. Integrating API with the Database
**Objective:**
- To establish seamless connectivity between the API and the database, enabling automated data storage.

**Approach:**
- Used the `psycopg2` library to connect Python with PostgreSQL.
- Developed SQL queries to insert new records into the `weather` table.
- Implemented error handling to detect and resolve database connection issues efficiently.

### 4. Automating Data Retrieval
**Objective:**
- To ensure continuous and up-to-date weather data collection without manual intervention.

**Approach:**
- Utilized the `schedule` library to automate data retrieval at hourly intervals.
- Designed a function to fetch weather data and insert it into the database seamlessly.
- Implemented an execution loop to keep the script running in the background, periodically executing scheduled tasks.

## Conclusion
This automated weather data pipeline efficiently retrieves, stores, and manages real-time weather information, eliminating the need for manual data collection. The structured database design ensures data consistency, while the automation component guarantees timely updates. Future enhancements may include data visualization, predictive analytics, and integration with external applications for broader usability.
