Weather Data Pipeline Documentation

Project Overview
This project automates the retrieval, storage, and management of weather data using the WeatherStack API and a PostgreSQL database. The objective is to establish a structured data pipeline that continuously collects weather information at scheduled intervals, ensuring reliable data storage for future analysis and potential integration with other applications.

Implementation Approach
1. Fetching Weather Data
Objective:
To obtain real-time weather information from a trusted source and extract key parameters for storage.

Approach:
Integrated the WeatherStack API using the requests library to send GET requests.
Implemented robust error handling to manage API request failures and ensure reliability.
Parsed the JSON response to extract relevant meteorological attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and weather conditions.

2. Database Design & Setup
Objective:
To establish a structured database that supports efficient storage and retrieval of weather data.

Approach:
Designed and implemented a PostgreSQL database (Weather_App) to store collected weather data.
Created a weather table with essential attributes, including city, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric pressure, and timestamps.
Defined appropriate data types and constraints to maintain data integrity and consistency.

3. API-Database Integration
Objective:
To automate the process of storing retrieved weather data in the database without manual intervention.

Approach:
Established a connection between the Python script and the PostgreSQL database using psycopg2.
Developed an insertion script that dynamically stores fetched data into the weather table.
Implemented exception handling to address potential database errors and maintain data accuracy.

4. Automating Data Retrieval
Objective:
To ensure continuous data collection without requiring manual execution.

Approach:
Utilized the schedule library to automate the weather data retrieval process at hourly intervals.
Designed a scheduled job that fetches and stores weather data seamlessly.
Implemented a looping mechanism to keep the script running indefinitely, executing the scheduled tasks as required.

Conclusion
This project successfully delivers a fully automated weather data pipeline, ensuring continuous and structured data collection. The integration of API-based data retrieval, database storage, and automation minimizes manual effort while maintaining data reliability. Future enhancements may include data visualization, trend analysis, and predictive modeling to extract deeper insights from the collected weather data.
